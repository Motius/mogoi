*An always-on autonomous AI daemon with desktop awareness, multi-agent hierarchy, visual workflows, and goal pursuit.*

MOGOI is not a chatbot with tools. It is a persistent daemon that sees your screen, understands what you're doing, and acts — within the authority limits you define. Run it on a server for 24/7 availability, then connect sidecars on your laptop, desktop, or any other machine to give it eyes and hands everywhere.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
bun install -g @motius/brain   # Install the daemon
mogoi start -d                   # Start as background daemon
```

Open `http://localhost:1846` — the dashboard walks you through LLM provider, voice, and a quick conversational profile interview the first time you visit.

---

## 🪨 Ambient mode

MOGOI ships a "dashboard-less" experience built around a small cursor-following pebble — **on by default** after onboarding. Just run:

```bash
bun run start
```

What you get:

- **Pebble** — a small paper-toned disc that follows your cursor. Wake-word ("Hey Mogoi"), `Ctrl+Space`, or click summons it. Long-press the disc to blind awareness instantly (privacy toggle); the eye glyph next to it shows when MOGOI is actively reading your screen.
- **Native windows** — every dashboard room (workflows, memory, settings, …) opens as a real Windows window via voice ("open settings", "show me workflows") or `Ctrl+K`. No browser tab.
- **Sub-pebble rail** — say "in the background, research X" and a colored sub-pebble flies to the right edge of your screen. Click it to see what the agent is doing; "open full ↗" pops a dedicated result panel.
- **Voice-first** — "what's on my screen?", "close all background agents", "open the workflows window", "in the background, summarize today's meeting notes" — all routed inline, no LLM round-trip for the common verbs.

Currently **Windows-only** (cross-platform ports planned). The `localhost:1846` dashboard still works as a fallback / debug surface.

> **Opt out:** set `MOGOI_AMBIENT_UI=0` to disable the pebble + sidecar voice loop (useful for headless servers, CI, or users who only want the web dashboard).

## ☁️ Managed Hosting

Don't want to deal with servers, DNS, or TLS certificates? We've partnered with **[opencove.host](https://opencove.host)** — a managed hosting platform built specifically for MOGOI.

- **No self-hosting hassle** — no server to provision, no dependencies to install
- **Dedicated domain included** — no need to buy a domain or configure DNS and TLS
- **Up and running in under 5 minutes** — spin up your MOGOI instance and start using it immediately

Visit [opencove.host](https://opencove.host) to get started.

---

## 💡 Use Cases

**Research while you work** — Ask MOGOI to deep-dive a topic. It runs browser searches, reads pages, and compiles a summary in the background while you focus on other things.

**Automate across machines** — Run the daemon on your home server. Connect sidecars on your work laptop and your desktop. MOGOI can move files between them, run scripts on your server, and open apps on your laptop — all from one conversation.

**Inbox triage** — Set up a workflow that monitors your Gmail, categorizes incoming messages, drafts replies for your review, and schedules follow-ups on your calendar.

**Desktop co-pilot** — MOGOI watches your screen via the sidecar. If it sees you struggling with an error message or a complex form, it proactively offers help or fills in fields for you.

**Goal accountability** — Define OKRs in the Goals dashboard. MOGOI plans your day each morning, checks in during the evening, and escalates if you're falling behind — like a personal drill sergeant.

**Multi-step workflows** — Build visual automations with 50+ node types: "when a file appears in this folder, OCR it, extract key data, update the spreadsheet, and notify me on Telegram."

---

## 📋 Requirements

- **Bun** >= 1.0 (installed automatically if missing)
- **OS (native daemon install)**: macOS, Linux, or WSL
- **Windows**: native Windows is not supported for the daemon - use WSL2 for the Bun install, or Docker for the daemon
- **LLM API key** — at least one of: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, or a local Ollama instance

---

## 📦 Installation

### bun (recommended)

```bash
bun install -g @motius/brain
mogoi start
```

The first time you run `mogoi start`, the daemon boots in setup mode and the dashboard at `http://localhost:1846` guides you through LLM provider, voice (TTS) choice, a conversational profile interview, and a 10-minute spotlight tour.

> **Restart after first-time setup:** The daemon constructs background services (heartbeat, commitments, awareness) at boot, gated on setup having already been completed. Once you finish setup in the dashboard, those services don't activate until the next start — the dashboard shows a banner reminding you. Run `mogoi restart` (or stop/start) to bring them online. This will go away in a follow-up that constructs the services in-process at setup completion.

> **Note:** Native Windows is not a supported platform for the MOGOI daemon. MOGOI is built for Unix-like systems (macOS, Linux, and WSL); supporting native Windows would mean porting to a fundamentally different OS, which is out of scope. On Windows, use WSL2 for the Bun install above, or use the Docker install instead.

### Docker

Run MOGOI on any OS with a single command — no Bun or dependencies required. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Windows, macOS, Linux) if you don't have Docker yet.

```bash
docker run -d --name mogoi \
  -p 1846:1846 \
  -v mogoi-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/Motius/mogoi:latest
```

The image is available on [GHCR](https://ghcr.io/Motius/mogoi). Non-LLM configuration can be provided via environment variables or by mounting a `config.yaml` into the `/data` volume. LLM providers, API keys, and model routing are configured from the settings dashboard (open http://localhost:1846 after first boot) and stored in the database + encrypted keychain - they are not set via env vars or `config.yaml`.

> **Note:** Docker runs in an isolated container, so the daemon inside it cannot access your host desktop, browser, or clipboard directly. You must still install the [sidecar](#️-sidecar-setup) on each machine where you want MOGOI to have desktop awareness and automation capabilities.

### One-liner

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Motius/mogoi/main/install.sh | bash
```

After opening a new terminal, run:

```bash
mogoi start
```

The install script sets up Bun, clones the repo, and links the `mogoi` CLI. Then finish setup in your browser at `http://localhost:1846`.

> **Note:** The one-liner only supports macOS, Linux, and WSL. Native Windows shells such as PowerShell, Git Bash, and CMD should use WSL2 or the Docker install instead.

### Manual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Motius/mogoi.git ~/.mogoi/daemon
cd ~/.mogoi/daemon
bun install
bun run build:ui
bun link
mogoi start
```

Then open `http://localhost:1846` to finish setup in the dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
mogoi start            # Start in foreground
mogoi start -d         # Start as background daemon
mogoi start --port 1846 # Start on a specific port
mogoi stop             # Stop the daemon
mogoi status           # Check if running
mogoi doctor           # Verify environment & connectivity
mogoi logs -f          # Follow live logs
```

The dashboard is available at `http://localhost:1846` once the daemon is running.

### Logs

`mogoi start -d` writes the daemon's output to `~/.mogoi/logs/mogoi.log`, and
`mogoi logs -f` follows it. Started any other way - in the foreground, under
systemd, in Docker - there is no file: output goes to the terminal, `journalctl`
or `docker logs`. To get the same file in every launch mode, add to
`~/.mogoi/config.yaml`:

```yaml
daemon:
  log_file_path: "~/.mogoi/logs/mogoi.log"
  log_file_max_bytes: 1048576   # optional, defaults to 1 MiB
```

The daemon mirrors its output there in addition to wherever it already goes.
Lines are timestamped, stripped of terminal colour codes, and run through the
credential redactor, so the file is safe to hand to someone debugging. It is
capped: past `log_file_max_bytes` the oldest lines are dropped, so it settles at
roughly that size instead of filling the disk. Unset means no file.

The cap is an in-memory ring as well as a file size, so `log_file_max_bytes` is
an RSS budget too - 1 MiB of log is 1 MiB of daemon memory. It is clamped to
4 KiB..64 MiB.

One thing to expect from `mogoi logs -f`: it runs `tail -F`, and every time the
cap is enforced the file is replaced, so `tail` reopens it and reprints the
whole window. At the default size that is ~1 MiB of already-seen lines about
every 256 KiB of new output. That is inherent to capping one file in place, not
a bug.

### Updating

`mogoi update` detects how you installed MOGOI and runs the right update command. Equivalent manual commands per install method:

| Install method | `mogoi update` dispatches to |
| --- | --- |
| Bun global (`bun install -g @motius/brain`) | `bun update -g @motius/brain` |
| `install.sh` (git clone under `~/.mogoi/daemon`) | `git pull --ff-only` + `bun install` |
| Docker | Refused — run `docker pull <image> && docker rm -f mogoi && docker run ...` on the host |
| Developer checkout | Refused — run `git pull` yourself |

Run `mogoi doctor` to see what was detected and the exact commands for your install.

### Removing MOGOI

`mogoi uninstall` stops the daemon, removes autostart hooks, deletes `~/.mogoi`, and — where applicable — runs the correct package-manager uninstall. It does **not** touch sidecars.

| Install method | `mogoi uninstall` dispatches to |
| --- | --- |
| Bun global | `bun uninstall -g @motius/brain` + side-effect cleanup |
| `install.sh` | `rm -rf ~/.mogoi/daemon` + CLI wrapper + side-effect cleanup |
| Docker | Refused — run `docker rm -f mogoi` (and optionally `docker volume rm mogoi-data`) on the host |
| Developer checkout | Side-effect cleanup only — your checkout is left in place |

> **Tip:** If you already ran `bun uninstall -g @motius/brain` without going through `mogoi uninstall`, your daemon may still be running and `~/.mogoi` is still on disk. Run `mogoi doctor` before uninstalling to see what will be cleaned up, or stop the daemon and remove `~/.mogoi` manually.

---

## 🖥️ Sidecar Setup

The sidecar is what gives MOGOI physical reach beyond the machine it runs on. It is a lightweight agent that you install on any machine — your laptop, a dev server, a home PC — and it connects back to the central daemon over an authenticated WebSocket. Each sidecar gives MOGOI access to that machine's desktop, browser, terminal, filesystem, clipboard, and screenshots.

This means you can run the daemon on an always-on server and still interact with your desktop machines as if MOGOI were running locally. Enroll as many sidecars as you want.

### 1. Install the sidecar

**Via bun:**

```bash
bun install -g @motius/sidecar
```

**Or download the binary** from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Motius/mogoi/releases) for your platform (macOS, Linux, Windows).

### 2. Enroll in the dashboard

1. Open the MOGOI dashboard at `http://localhost:1846`
2. Go to **Settings** → **Sidecar**
3. Enter a friendly name for this machine (e.g. "work laptop") and click **Enroll**
4. Click **Copy** to copy the token command

### 3. Run the sidecar

Just start it:

```bash
mogoi
```

The first time it runs unconfigured, a small **setup window** pops up asking for
the enrollment token — paste the token you copied and click **Connect**. The
sidecar saves it locally (`~/.mogoi/sidecar.yaml`) and connects.

Prefer the terminal / a headless box? Pass the token on the CLI instead (no
window):

```bash
mogoi --token <your-token>
```

Either way, subsequent runs are just `mogoi` (the saved token is reused).

Once connected, the sidecar appears as online in the Settings page where you can configure its capabilities (terminal, filesystem, desktop, browser, clipboard, screenshot, awareness, file watch, processes, notifications). The host-sensing observers (clipboard, file watch, process monitor, desktop notifications) run inside the sidecar on your machine and stream to the brain - the brain no longer observes its own host.

### Versioning & updates

The sidecar is versioned **independently of the brain** (`bun update -g @motius/sidecar`, or grab a newer binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Motius/mogoi/releases) -- the `sidecar-vX.Y.Z` releases). Run `mogoi --version` to see what you have.

On connect, the brain checks the sidecar's version against its compatibility floors and surfaces the result in **Settings -> Sidecar**:

- **OK** -- up to date enough; nothing to do.
- **Update available** -- still compatible, but the brain recommends a newer sidecar; update when convenient.
- **Update required** -- too old for this brain; the connection is refused and the sidecar logs an "update required" message. Update the sidecar and restart it.

Local development builds report `dev` and are never blocked.

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

**Conversations** — Multi-provider LLM routing (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Ollama). Streaming responses, personality engine, vault-injected memory context on every message.

**Tool Execution** — 14+ builtin tools with up to 200 iterations per turn. The agent loop runs until the task is complete, not until the response looks done.

**Memory & Knowledge** — Vault knowledge graph (entities, facts, relationships) stored in SQLite. Extracted automatically after each response. Injected into the system prompt so MOGOI always remembers what matters.

**Browser Control** — Auto-launches Chromium via CDP. 7 browser tools handle navigation, interaction, extraction, and form filling.

**Desktop Automation** — Go sidecar with JWT-authenticated WebSocket, RPC protocol, and binary streaming. Win32 API automation (EnumWindows, UIAutomation, SendKeys) on Windows, X11 tools on Linux.

**Multi-Agent Hierarchy** — `delegate_task` and `manage_agents` tools. An AgentTaskManager coordinates 9 specialist roles. Sub-agents are denied governed actions — authority stays with the top-level agent.

**Voice Interface** — Edge TTS or ElevenLabs with streaming sentence-by-sentence playback. Binary WebSocket protocol carries mic audio (WebM) and TTS audio (MP3) on the same connection. Wake word via openwakeword (ONNX, runs in-browser).

**Continuous Awareness** — Full desktop capture at 5-10 second intervals. Hybrid OCR (Tesseract.js) + Cloud Vision. Struggle detection, activity session inference, entity-linked context graph. Proactive suggestions and an overlay widget.

**Workflow Automation** — Visual builder powered by `@xyflow/react`. 50+ nodes across 5 categories. Triggers: cron, webhook, file watch, screen events, polling, clipboard, process, git, email, calendar. NL chat creation, YAML export/import, retry + fallback + AI-powered self-heal.

**Goal Pursuit** — OKR hierarchy (objective → key result → daily action). Google-style 0.0-1.0 scoring. Morning planning, evening review, drill sergeant escalation. Awareness pipeline auto-advances progress. Three dashboard views: kanban, timeline, metrics.

**Authority & Autonomy** — Runtime enforcement with soft-gate approvals. Multi-channel approval delivery (chat, Telegram). Full audit trail. Emergency pause/kill controls. Consecutive-approval learning suggests auto-approve rules.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

MOGOI stores its system configuration at `~/.mogoi/config.yaml`; user-level settings live in its database and are managed from the dashboard. Access is **JWT-only by default**: run `mogoi enroll "<device-name>"` and paste the printed token into the sidecar (desktop app), which connects and gives you the dashboard. Setting up without a sidecar? Temporarily add `auth:\n  insecure_open_access: true` to config.yaml, open `http://localhost:1846` after `mogoi start` for the guided setup, then **remove the flag** once your device is enrolled. The Settings room lets you tweak channels, personality, and authority later.

Running the brain on another machine — a home server, a LAN box, or a VPS with a domain? Read [docs/SELF_HOSTING.md](docs/SELF_HOSTING.md) for the reverse-proxy setup, `brain_domain`, device enrollment across machines, and what plain-HTTP access does and doesn't support.

```yaml
daemon:
  port: 1846
  data_dir: "~/.mogoi"
  db_path: "~/.mogoi/mogoi.db"

llm:
  primary: "anthropic"
  fallback: ["openai", "gemini", "ollama"]
  anthropic:
    api_key: "sk-ant-..."
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-6"

```

The **daemon** is the brain — it holds the LLM connections, memory vault, agent hierarchy, and all decision-making. It can run on a home server, a VPS, or your local machine.

**Sidecars** are the hands. Each sidecar is a lightweight Go binary that connects to the daemon and exposes its host machine's capabilities. The daemon can orchestrate actions across all connected sidecars simultaneously. Sidecars authenticate via JWT and communicate over a binary WebSocket protocol.

This separation means MOGOI stays reachable 24/7 on a server while still being able to see your screen, type in your apps, and manage files on any machine where a sidecar is running.

## 📊 Telemetry

MOGOI sends **anonymous** usage metrics so the project can measure its unique
user base and retention. Each ping contains only a hashed machine id (derived
from hostname + username, never reversible to either), the app version, the
install method, and the OS/arch. No personal data, config, content, or feature
usage is ever sent. Pings go out at startup and every hour.

It is on by default (opt-out). Disable it with any of:

```yaml
# ~/.mogoi/config.yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: false
```

```bash
MOGOI_TELEMETRY=0   # or the cross-tool standard: DO_NOT_TRACK=1
```

Full details: [docs/TELEMETRY.md](docs/TELEMETRY.md).

---

## 🔒 Security

MOGOI includes a built-in authority engine that gates every action at runtime. All tool executions are logged in an audit trail, and sensitive operations require explicit approval via the dashboard or Telegram. Emergency pause and kill controls are always available.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately by emailing the maintainer rather than opening a public issue.
