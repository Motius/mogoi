/**
 * `@mogoipieces/piece-mogoi-test` -- a fixture piece used only by the
 * engine-runtime end-to-end tests. Provides a `manual` trigger that returns
 * its propsValue.payload (so flows starting with this trigger don't need
 * external infrastructure) and an `echo` action that returns its inputs.
 *
 * Not shipped or surfaced in the dashboard catalog. Lives under
 * packages/pieces/mogoi/test/ next to the production Mogoi pieces so the
 * piece-loader picks it up via the same dev-pieces flow.
